# Newton-Raphson method
 Newton-Raphson method is a numerical technique used to find a root of a function with any starting value. This method has a quadratic rate of convergence. Though it is very efficient, it has a disadvantage of being unstable if the slope tends to zero.
 The iterative procedure is given by: x(i+1) = x(i) - f(x(i))/df(x(i));
